/**
 * Summary of Changes and Reasoning
 * 
 * This script contains no functional changes; it's a minimal test script
 * designed to validate basic execution. The shebang and exit 0 are explicitly
 * included for portability across different environments.
 * 
 * Reasoning:
 * This lightweight test is intended to verify the Vibe Compiler's dry-run mode
 * by executing 'node output/current/bin/vibec.js --dry-run', ensuring the 
 * script can run without errors.
