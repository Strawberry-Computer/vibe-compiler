# Add Colored Logging

Enhance vibec.js with a colored logging utility for better output readability:
- Define a `log` object with methods: info, warn, error, success, debug (enabled via VIBEC_DEBUG).
- Use ANSI color codes for terminal output (e.g., green for success, red for error).
- Replace all console.log calls with appropriate log methods.
- Maintain current behavior but improve visibility.
