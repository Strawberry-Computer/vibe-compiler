# Add Prompt Caching

Implement prompt hashing and caching:
- Create .vibec_hashes.json to store prompt hashes and success status.
- Skip unchanged prompts that previously succeeded.
- Update after each prompt processes.
- Pay extra attention to syntax: ensure all strings are properly formatted and code is complete.
