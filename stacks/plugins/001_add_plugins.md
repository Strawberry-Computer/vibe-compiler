# Add Plugin Support

Introduce static and dynamic plugin support:
- Load static .md plugins from stacks/plugins/ and append to prompts.
- Load dynamic .js plugins (async functions) and execute with context.
- Add context with config, stack, promptNumber, promptContent, workingDir.

## Context: bin/vibec.js
## Output: bin/vibec.js
