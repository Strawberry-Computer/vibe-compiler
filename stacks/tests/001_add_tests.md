# Add Initial Test Script

Generate a test script for vibec:
- Create `test.sh` to verify `output/current/bin/vibec.js` exists.
- Run `node output/current/bin/vibec.js --dry-run > test-output.txt` to ensure it executes without errors. Make sure you actually write to file vs stdout.
    - In --dry-run mode, it's expected print the prompt to console and skip LLM API call. It always gonna process the same response: 'File: example/file\n```lang\ncontent\n```'
- Use `set -ex` at the start for debugging: exit on failure, print commands.
- Output to `test.sh` in the root of the stage/current directory.
- Exit with 0 on success, 1 on failure.
- Use `node` explicitly to run `vibec.js`; do not assume itâ€™s directly executable.

## Context: bin/vibec.js, test.sh
## Output: test.sh
