# Enhance Test Script

Enhance test.sh with more robust tests:
- Add checks for CLI functionality (e.g., `node output/current/bin/vibec.js --help`, `--version`).
- Keep it simple and fail-safe: no external dependencies like Jest yet.
- Output to test.sh in the root of the stage/current directory.

## Context: bin/vibec.js, output/current/test.sh
## Output: test.sh
