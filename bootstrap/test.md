Generate a Bash test script with the following exact content:
- Start with a shebang: #!/bin/bash
- Echo the string "Tests passed" to stdout
- Exit with code 0
- Verify the Vibe Compilerâ€™s dry-run mode by executing 'node output/current/bin/vibec.js --dry-run', ensuring the script can run without errors
Output only the script content, nothing else.
